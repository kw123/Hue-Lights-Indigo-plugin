========================================
2022.11.32 @ 2022-07-16

* ADDED support for Hue Rotary Wall Switch (4 Tap Switches w rotary ring) 
  the most usefull dimmer in the Hue portfolio - In my opinion
  using 
  types   = ZLLRelativeRotary and ZLLswitch
  modelId = RDM002
  it will create 2 indigo devices: 
  hueRotaryWallSwitches (ZLLswitch)  for the 4 buttons
  hueRotaryWallRing (ZLLRelativeRotary)  for the ring to dimm lights 
  on the hue bridge it is also 2 virtual devices 

* ADDED action & menu to dis(en)-able sensor devices (temp, motion, switches) 
  this can be useful when you want to disable certain sensors at night or when you are out or at home
  this is done by setting  element "config":{"on":true/false} on the bridge for the selected device
  you can see which sensors are on/off with report in menu/print hue config../sensors 
  
* ADDED menu option to rename devices on bridge
  you can change individual devices  with free text or all and change the name on the bridge to the indigo device name 
  !! max number of characters is 32 for names on bridge !!
  there is an option to drop the "Hue_bridge_id_"nameOnBridge prefix of indigo names on the bridge for devices generated using plugin/menu/Add new devices
  
* ADDED option "Where to log device value changes"  received from hue bridge
  either (1) in regular indigo log and plugin.log   or   (2) ONLY in plugin.log file in indigo log direcotry
  with this option you can declutter your normal indigo logfile from regular messsages
  reminder: ALL log messages are ALWAYS in the plugin.log file 
 
* ADDED option to print detailed tracking info for ONE specific Sensor or light to logfile 
  this is useful to track the detailed behavior and logic in the plugin for ONE specific device when eg buttons are pressed 
 
*  There are now various options to log device changes in plugin config 
  - on for all devices
  - off for all
  - set in each device individually
  - log in indigo log and plugin.log or only in plugin.log file 
  - set the default for each new device created

* CHANGED state lastupdated is now local time, not UTC  eg 2022-07-12 12:33:45 in stead of 2022-07-12T06:33:45 for USA east cost time zone
   that state is not the last time when an indigo state was updated, but when a new EVENT time stamp arrived

* FIXED bug for  "wall switch" devices status was not properly updated
  REMARK: The defined logic is not 100% correct. There are several modes (set on the bridge), ie when set to on/off
  on bridge the indigo state on/off only stays up for a few seconds. It should stay up as long as the button is pressed.
  This is also the case for all other switch sensors. 
  This will only be corrected going from simple polling every 2 secs to async listening, BUT that is a major structural change for the plugin
   this will take some time

* CHANGED: added debug statement for 'hubNumber' error



========================================
2022.11.31 @ 2022-07-01
fixed
* on/off state and bright ness not properly updating for dimmable lamps 
* fixed on/offstate for all lamps made it consitent
* fixed # of decimal point for RGB, White level, Color Temperature in indigo dev status display


========================================
2022.11.29 @ 2022-06-22 
New functions:
* added state "created". It shows date-time stamp of when device was created, or if it is empty put current stamp in, ie for old devices, as we don't know when they were created.
  this is only useful for new devices created after this release  

* added config option for default logging level(print received value updates to indigo log) for individual devices when they get auto created through "menu/create new devices...", which scannes all bridges and adds missing devices to indigo.

Improvements:
* hue bridge adoption now semi-automatic in background 
  in config after bridgeNumber and ip number confirmed it will try to pair/link to bridge and will show positive result in a popup window
  you still need to press the philips button on top of the bridge
  This way the plugin trys to link to the bridge every 5 seconds. It should succeeed as soon as you go to the bridge and press the button there.
  In case that process fails there is still the execute pair button in the config menu, which starts the paring process after you press the execute pair button

*streamlined device updates: instead of 10+ individual state updates, now it checks if there is a change in state value and then combines updates to a list. 
    That should reduce server load from updates significantly

Fixes:
* fixed some issues in print hue config menu

* lots of little clean-up of typos etc



========================================
2022.11.28 @ 2022-06-19 
*extended expiration time for confirming bridge # to 120 secs (from 15 secs) 
 that should deal with message bridge confirm popup error message 
 Also now after successfull delete / change IP# and (re-)pair bridge 
 the config menu goes back to first step: "Select action for the bridge"

========================================
2022.11.27 @ 2022-06-18 
*fix bugs: 
- line 5383, in excecStatesUpdate;  type: dictionary changed size during iteration
- line 9575, in setColorTemperature:  if bulbId is None or bulbId == 0:

*added debug statement to ID the device for error msg:
-  line 6397, .... 'key brightnessLevel not found in dict'

* added some more config edit controls to make sure data is entered properly
- fields appear only when previous steps taken.



========================================
2022.11.26 @ 2022-06-04
*fix bug:  is not a dimmer device 
*restructured config menu to make it easier to understand 
  for manaing bridges in config flow is now
  - select action (add(pair) / modify(IP) / delete)
  - select select bridge #
  - then set new Ip# ..
  - confirm
  with success / failure popup messages
  ==> should be easy to understand now 

*changed error logging to std python error logging
*added code to check if devices are "orphaned" ie have no bridge or a non existing bridge associated
* *** this version  requires python3 ie only runs uder indigo 2022.1 and later  ***


========================================
2022.11.24 @ 2022-06-02
*bug fix: auto create hue devices did not set rgb white etc properties correctly
*bug fix: save preset error 
*minor menu text changes
*in device light and group edit:
 - only current device is shown
 - if not created yet (=new dev) only NOT used hue devices (ie no indigo dev) are shown
*additions to menu print hue info 
  ie print hue dev but no corresponding indigo dev and visa versa, some more formatted info for other print xxx menu options  
*made MANY more things table driven, not hard coded in plugin, 
 ie supports-xx xx= batterylevel rgb, white, onoff, sensorvalue, is dimmerdevice  etc. 
 all is set in file supportedDevices.py
*added functionality to scan network for hue bridges.
 this done in the backgroud every 5 minutes (using /usr/bin/dns-sd functionality )
 the list of network scan found bridges is available in config when you want to add a new bridge
 in config you can ask to have the scan run immediately.
 if you already know the ipnumber of your bridge this is not needed, but the ip # field is filled out automatically

* *** this version now requires python3 ie only runs uder indigo 2022.1 and later  ***
  it might still work under py2 (earlier than indigo 2022.1) You need to change api version to 2.0 from 3.0 in info.plist, but no support for that



========================================
1.10.24 @ 2022-05-22
*several bug fixes
*config menu was rewritten, should make it much easier to setup / modify bridge settings etc
  reduces error messages if wrong parameters are set etc.
*logging/debug toggle in menu and detailed logging selection in config
*some language clarification in menus 
*  *** still runs under indigo 2022.1 and earlier ***
*  *** if no other MAJOR bugs found, this should be the last version that uns under Python2 ***


========================================
1.10.22 @ 2022-05-14

========================================
1.10.20 @ 2022-04-6
* added dev name to >> Set hue device to   ..<< to >> Set hue device:"devName" to ...<



========================================

* added some more print options and some bugs were fixed 

========================================
1.9.14 @ 2022-03-16
* did a lot of testing 
* fixed several bugs ie when more than one bridge is used
* added several print options (for rules, schedules, resource links, config, user lists (whitelist) etc)
* added print option for orphanes, indigo devices that do not exists anymore on the bridge
* tested with 3 bridges, 70+ lights, 30+ sensors/ switches

========================================
1.9.12
* following recommendations from Jay
* removed autocreate folder for new devices, now it will only create a folder when you execute menu: "Create all HUE light devices in indigo if they do not exist already"
* removed debug setting from config. now ONLY in menu. only in one place. Menu is better as you likely want to easily switch it on and then off to avoid a lot pages printed to logfile.

1.0.1 (30-Jul-2013)
* Added the indigoPluginUpdateChecker module (code by Travis CooK) to facilitate automatic plugin version checking.
--
1.0 (03-Jul-2013)
* Updated brightness status code to accurately reflect a 1 percent brightness level (rather than rounding up to 2 percent).
* Added Default Brightness property for Hue Bulbs devices so their features are more consistent with other lighting devices in Indigo (such as SwitchLinc and LampLinc Dimmers).
* Changed "on", "off", and "toggle" action control functions so that sending an "on" command to a Hue Bulb from within Indigo returns the bulb to its previous brightness level, or its default brightness level (if set).
* Updated Brightness, HSB, and Color Temperature setting methods so that they properly save the brightness level specified in those actions to the Hue Bulb's device properties for recall should an "on" command be sent to it.
* Updated the bulb status gathering method so that if the bulb brightness changes outside of the Hue Lights plugin (or the hub updates the bulb brightness during a long transition time), Hue Lights does not save the new brightness to the bulb properties and thus causing an "on" command later to recall an incorrect previous brightness state.
* Changed the logging slightly to more closely match the log format of native INSTEON device changes.
--
0.10.2 (24-Jun-2013)
* Added more code to work better with LivingWhites bulbs.
--
0.10.1 (24-Jun-2013)
* Modified debugging code so it wouldn't throw errors when the plugin is installed on versions of Indigo Pro earlier than version 5.1.7.
* Added the LWB003 model ID to the list of recognized Hue models.
--
0.10.0 (12-Jun-2013)
* Added a Hue Bulb Attribute Controller virtual dimmer device which can be created to control a specific attribute (hue, saturation, RGB levels, or color temperature) of an existing Hue Lights bulb device.
* Added an "Effect" action which allows you to specify an effect to be turned on for a Hue bulb (requires latest firmware on the Hue hub. Currently, only the Color Loop effect is supported by the Hue hub and bulbs).
* Changed light control methods so that if the current light brightness is below 6% and the requested action is to turn off the bulb, set the ramp rate to 0 regardless of the default or specified ramp rate (transition time) because going from a brightness of 6% or lower to an off state with a dimming rate isn't noticeable.
--
0.9.11 (10-Apr-2013)
* Updated code to more elegantly handle non-Hue devices attached to the Hue hub.
--
0.9.10 (02-Apr-2013)
* Fixed a bug that would cause the plugin to crash if a registered bulb on the Hue hub had no "hue" attribute (which could happen when using "LivingWhites" plugin dimmers found in some European countries).
--
0.9.9 (24-Jan-2013)
* Attempted to make RGB-to-xyY conversions more accurate by changing the illuminant used by the colormath functions from type "a" to type "e".
--
0.9.8 (23-Jan-2013)
* Fixed a bug that would crash the plugin if no device was selected in a start/stopBrightening/Dimming action when the action was executed.
* Fixed a bug that would cause an error during device creation dialog validation for new Hue Light devices in Indigo 5.x.
--
0.9.7 (31-Dec-2012)
* Fixed a bug that updated the "hue" state of plugin devices with an invalid number when the setHSB action was used.
--
0.9.6 (31-Dec-2012)
* Fixed a divide by zero error in getBulbStatus that could happen if the Hue hub returns no value for a bulb’s color temperature.
--
0.9.5 (27-Dec-2012)
* Fixed bug that would cause the Hue light not to turn off if using RGB mode when Red, Green, and Blue were all zero.
--
0.9.4 (27-Nov-2012)
* Fixed bug that would return an error if no default ramp rate were entered for a Hue bulb device.
* Added more debug logging.
* Changed how logging is done to be more consistent with other Indigo device update events. A log entry now appears after the physical device has changed (as was always the case) but now it appears before the Indigo device state is updated.
* Increased delay between status update requests to about 8 seconds to decrease number of requests per minute sent to the Hue hub.
--
0,9.3 (18-Nov-2012)
* Fixed typo (bug) that caused the plugin to crash when the Hue hub was unreachable within the timeout period.
* Worked around a colormath bug that would throw a ZeroDivisionError if the "y" component was zero.
* Added checks in bulb status gathering to prevent unnecessary Indigo device status updates. Added logging for any device brightness updates detected.
* Added more exception handling for HTTP requests to hub.
* Slightly tweaked status request timing.
--
0.9.2 (17-Nov-2012)
* Corrected error in actionControlDimmerRelay that prevented setBrightness call from working.
--
0.9.1 (16-Nov-2012)
* Tweaked brightening and dimming timing for Start Brightening and Start Dimming actions so the rate was about the same speed as SmartLabs SwithcLinc Dimmers and LampLinc Dimmers.
* Removed code that immediately changes the RGB color states for the Indigo device as the values entered by the user are not actual displayed values. Actual values will be updated by the getBulbStatus method later.
* Added the "Set Brightness with Ramp Rate" action and associated plugin.py code. Renamed multiple methods for easier readability and for easier plugin scripting within Indigo.  Reorganized order in which methods appear in the source code for a more logical layout.
--
0.9 (13-Nov-2012)
* Initial Nathan Sheldon forked beta release.
* This version removes the use of the "ColorPy" library from Alistair's version and replaces it with the "colormath" library as it includes the ability to specify a target illumination source during color conversion, thus presenting a closer RGB to xyY conversion (and vice-versa).
* Most of Alistair's original code was rewritten to remain consistent with coding conventions in my other plugins, but some of his code is still in here.
