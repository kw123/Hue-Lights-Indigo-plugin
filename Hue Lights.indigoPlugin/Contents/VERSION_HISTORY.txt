========================================
2022.27.75 @ 2026-02-15
1. bug fixes for new device triggers, move devices to new bridge, security contact device


========================================
2022.27.74 @ 2026-02-15
1. added stats for # of packages send / received
2. cleanup frequency for different http requests. It is now per type and per bridge
   pro bridge as compared to old bridge type has about 1/5 the packages (incl events) and ~ 1/3 # of bytes.
   with 2 bridges, one old and one pro  and ~ 80 physical devices the average load on a MAC M1 is  -0.5-6% averaging ~ 2.5% 
   and response time to devices changes on the pro bridge is < 0.5 seconds
3. added support for security contact. only works with pro bridge
   looks like phillips is not adding api v1 support for newer models
   api v1 does not send any info for that device on old bridge as well as new bridge
4. removed unnecessary items from device edit.
   it is now very simple. 
   Disabled "create new device" for std Hue devices, beside "hue attribute controller"
   all std devices are automatically created by the plugin.
5. added a print option to show the network traffic used (menu "print hue config .."" at bottom)
   
   

========================================
2022.25.70 @ 2026-02-03
1. added menu to ignore/ disable hue device creation in indigo. Normally the plugin will auto create a missing device in indigo.
  This option will prevent this for selected hue devices (light, sensor, groups)


========================================
2022.24.70 @ 2026-01-27
1. removed a debug statement
2. reversed a json.loads statement. apparently older python versions a fickle with single quote signes: json.loads("{'a':1}") errors - not in the current indigo version though
3. fixed a bug: deleting a device and auto re-creating it caused an error. - it kept the old info in temporary dicts. 




========================================
2022.24.68 @ 2026-01-25
1. removed some api v2 debug statements



========================================
2022.24.67 @ 2026-01-23
1. fixed bug  in print config, # of users and # of scence were flipped
2. added event data will  update "enabled", "health" for motion area devices
3. added events for groups. Now rooms cenes get updated dynamically for hue pro bridges
4. reduced indigo dev state updates. In my setup cpu usage down from 3-10% to 0.5-5%

========================================
2022.23.66 @ 2026-01-18
1. fixed bug introduced in 2022.23.64

========================================
2022.23.64 @ 2026-01-18
1. added assign modelid if not found in defs to similar device eg if RDM005 not defined, try to look in product name to find know device that matches
2. added support for hue motion area events: with the new pro bridge you can use the lamps in the room to detect movements
 if you have setup a motionarea zone then the plugin will create the corresponding device and will set onOffState to True=on  / False=off if motion is detected /  expired.
3. added eventNumber to motion devices (lso ond ones), +=1 if state goes from off to on


========================================
2022.22.64 @ 2026-01-14
1. added new smart button version: RDM005 = hueSmartButton
2. clarified selections of hue bridge api and pro versions

========================================
2022.21.63 @ 2026-01-11
1. added various functions to support migration to pro bridge
- added menu to move individual devices or all from old to new bridge
- added option to print possible moves of devices to check consistency etc. 


========================================
2022.20.63 @ 2025-11-17
1. added various  steps to integrate hue pro bridge.
   now supports V2 events for lights and sensors,  
   not supported V2 groups, scenes.. using v1 api 



========================================
2022.16.60 @ 2025-11-17
1. added various  steps to integrate hue pro bridge.


========================================
2022.20.62@ 2025-11-05
A. added support for hue pro bridge
   this is the first beta version.
B. added print pro bridge events to log (for debugging )


steps:
0. Install the new plugin version
    delete in hue plugin the to be migrated bridge in config top item: "Add/delete/modify a bridge "
    this will not delete any indigo device
   
1. connect new pro bridge to network, power up
     if you have several bridges try to place the new one so that it can "see" all of them
     mine selected to use an already occupied zigbee channel, no problems so far, but I don't believe that is good.
     There are 4 channels available 11, 15, 20,25 (they share the wifi spectrum side bands)
[attachment=0]Screenshot 2025-11-05 at 13.19.58.png[/attachment] Modifying them after migration is not possible. you would need to reset everything (lamps switches, bridge..) and reinstall everything

2. follow described migration like in:
[url]https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/support/article/how-to-upgrade-to-the-hue-bridge-pro/000010[/url]
it will take some time as you must first update EVERYTHING 

3. after migration is complete, in plugin config 
   -Add/delete/modify a bridge 
   --add or re-pair a new bridge
   ---select the SAME bridge number you just deleted !! this is important !!
   --- if the bridge is not listed click "Exec Search now" and wait some seconds

4. press the button on the hue pro bridge

5. click on confirm

that should do it.
if automatic did not work use the manual steps.

All indigo  devices  of the deleted and  newly paid bridge should be working again w/o issues
Again !! you must use the same bridge number for old and new !!

There is a also a menu item to manually do these steps (overwrite bridge)
but only if you know how and why this works 
requires terminal interaction ...


This plugin version will NOT add any new functionality. it is using the same calls to the hue bridge, 
- Only some minor changes (https instead of http and verify=False in request calls)
- The pairing process had to be changed.
- the get basic configuration call was changed (check if the ip number is a hue bridge)

Any new functionality (using the new API calls)  in due time.

I like to make sure that this works completely before adding functions 

There is a also a menu item to manually do these steps (overwrite bridge)
   


========================================
2022.16.59 @ 2024-04-23
1. added option to enter serial number from the bulb (and sensor) into indigo device edit.
   This info is then available in reports ie print lights. 
   In case you have to re-learn a light to a hue hub you can get that info from here.
   BUT you need to maintain that info manually. There is no known way to get the serial number from the hub.


========================================
2022.16.58 @ 2024-04-07
1. fixed ACTION for preset


========================================
2022.16.57 @ 2024-04-01
1. fixed menue to exclude sensors in scenes and presets, or give warning msg

========================================
2022.16.56 @ 2024-04-01
1. fixed line 2496, in validateActionConfigUi ... type: 'in <string>' requires string as left operand, not type


========================================
2022.16.55 @ 2023-10-07
1. fixed add hue bridge manually
2. fixed find hue bridge automatically, 
   the tag used changed from Philips Hue to Hue Bridge. that is due to software changes on the bridge
   you now can change that string in config. 

========================================
2022.16.54 @ 2023-09-29
1. fixed some typos
2. changed lastBatteryUpdate :
  was: if new batterylevel ==100 and old < 100: set lastBatteryUpdate to current date
  now: added if lastBatteryUpdate is empty set to current date.
  if the battery level is less than 100 when you start the plugin you might need to wait for a loooong time before this state gets set ie if the battery live is 2 years
  this now gives you at east some date

========================================
2022.16.53 @ 2023-09-27
Added option to REPLACE a (eg broken) hue light in indigo -  ie keep the indigo ID (and trigger etc)  and link it to the new Hue device

In indigo device edit Lights you now have 3 options:
1. normal edit, no change
2. replace the hue device an indigo device is linked to
- add new hue device to hue bridge, then edit the old indigo device and select "replace device, select new Hue device"
3. copy other indigo device (eg already created indigo device for new replaced hue device, but you would like to keep triggers etc in place that use THIS indigo device id)
- edit old Indigo device and select option: "replace device, copy other Indigo device to this device"
  after save delete the indigo device that was copied from.

this should make it much easier to replace a broken light as compared to the previos plugin version: 2022.16.52


========================================
2022.16.52 @ 2023-09-27
Added option to REPLACE a ( eg broken) lamp in indigo -  ie keep the indigo ID (and trigger etc)  and link it to the new Hue device
steps:
1. add the new lamp to the hue bridge
2. add the new device to indigo (best is the auto create menue option)
3. disable Comm enabled for both new and old device in indigo  (uncheck the check box in the column Comm Enabled)
4. edit the OLD device (w the indigo id you want to keep)
5. check "Replace a device (not the normal option)" in device edit
6. select bridge and confirm
7. select the new Hue lamp in the selection menu. You will see the names of the lamps on the hue bridge not the indigo names
8. save
9. delete the NEW indigo device, otherwise you now have 2 indigo device that point to the same hue device
10. re-enable Comm for the OLD device (click on the check box in the column Comm Enabled)



========================================
2022.15.52 @ 2023-09-25
1. made the default value of option "auto create new devices":  OFF.
   This has no impact on existing installations, only when you (re) install the hue plugin the option will be set to OFF initially
   you can set it ON/OFF in config at any time.
   The tool tip / help in config reads: >> with this option checked the plugin will create a new indigo device as soon as a new light/sensor/group is created on a hue bridge.
   With the option OFF you can manually create new devices (add indigo device ... 
   Or you can use the menu item 'Add New Devices on Hue Bridge to Indigo' That will add all new devices that are on the hue bridge(s) in indigo<< 

   The change to OFF  has been requested by Jay, as it conflicts with indigo standards.


========================================
2022.15.51 @ 2023-09-11

1.  added state lastBatteryReplaced
    that states shows the date-time stamp when the battery level went from anything to 100%
    the first time it runs it checks if the state is empty and when the battery level is 100% hen it takes that date-time.
    otherwise it stays empty until the battery goes to 100%. that miht take some years depening on the battery life of the switch/ sensor.


	

========================================
2022.14.51 @ 2023-08-11

1.  fixed brightness level when using attribute devices to change eg hue value


========================================
2022.14.49 @ 2023-08-10

1. added device debug for hue attribute changes
2. added created state for attribute controller device 


========================================
2022.14.48 @ 2023-08-02

1. made http connect to bridge serial, ie put in a wait unitl last connect is finished
   this is to avoid time out when connecting to bridge by sevral threads at the same time.
   now they will happen after each other.
   if the wait is too long (3.5 secs) a warning gets printed to the log
   then you might want to reduce the frequency of polling the bridges in config.



========================================
2022.14.47 @ 2023-07-09

1. added menu option to help facilitate moving a device to a new bridge
   now besides light also sensors can be moved
   made the labels and sequence clearer (new vs old devs)

2. reduced the number of potential bridges to 5 from 9. One more that can be used in a house for future options
   this makes the selection menues shorter
   This is just cosmetics

========================================
2022.14.46 @ 2023-07-08

1. added menu option to help facilitate moving a device to a new bridge
   now besides light also sensors can be moved


========================================
2022.14.45 @ 2023-07-08

1. added menu option to help facilitate moving a device to a new bridge

========================================
2022.13.45 @ 2023-07-08

1. fixed some issues in print hue config data, for special cases


========================================
2022.13.44 @ 2023-06-02

1. fixed lights not selectable in track specific light
2. added set dev state of orphans  (devices on indigo but not on hue bridge) to "delete" instead of "disconnected" or "online"
3. added option to not show the logging test print at startup, you can set it in plugin config in debug section


========================================
2022.13.43 @ 2023-05-10

fixed groups did not get updated



========================================
2022.13.42 @ 2023-03-15

now NEW Hue lights, sensors, and groups will be automatically created in indigo (once every 3 minutes) 
That option can be switched off in config. 

So from now on: no need to manually ever create a new light/sensor/group.
At most 3 minutes after you add a new light bulb etc to your Hue system through your phone that light bulb ...  will appear automatically as an indigo device.
The name will be like:
Hue_type_Bridge#_Id#_name-One-Hue-System  eg: 
Hue_group_0_2_Wintergarten
Hue_light_1_11_Library spot 3  
Hue_sensor_2_14_Dining wall on off 2

The folder name can be set in config.



========================================
2022.12.42 @ 2023-03-15

* added help when adding new devices manually. if your selection of avalible light is empty, it will print something like:
++++++
   Hue Lights                      !!! no correntsponding light found, please check your selections !!!
your selection was: Bridge# 1, indigo devType:"hueLightStrips"="Light Strips" maps to hue-type:"Extended color light"

======================= mapping of devtypes END =====================

to the logfile.

The device type mappings between indigo and hue bridge are historical, and not simple to remember. 



!!! ===========================================  !!!
I strongly suggest not to add hue devices manually to indigo, but you should use the menu item:
"Add New Devices on Hue Bridge to Indigo..."

that will auto add all new devices found on any hue bridge to indigo in the proper form and device type
!!! ===========================================  !!!




========================================
2022.12.41 @ 2022-07-27

* fixed error: line 858, in validateRGBWhiteOnOffetc
* streamlined hue group edit, made selection clearer



========================================
2022.12.40 @ 2022-07-27

* added some more context when connection to hub bridge not is working


========================================
2022.12.39 @ 2022-07-25

* fixed adding hue bridges, fixed a major issue


========================================
2022.12.38 @ 2022-07-24

* added print option to print plugin prefs to logfile, for debugging purposes
* added more logging info when connection to bridge is failing
* fixed, during initialization: if conection to one bridge failed, all subsequent bridges were ignored



========================================
2022.12.37 @ 2022-07-23

* beautifications in logging and menus

* added one more check when adding a new bridge 
   fixing error: plugin.py", line 2686, in selHubNumberGWPair



========================================
2022.12.36 @ 2022-07-20

* fixed continuous logging for some sensors, even when nothing changed.



========================================
2022.12.34 @ 2022-07-19

* CHANGED # of state updates (online = false) for devices that are pysically w/o power from once every 5 secs to just once

* FIXED:  "line 7336, in parseOneHueSensorData if logChanges: self.indiLOG.log(20, "...   was a bad ")" in format statement

* ADDED  menu option: "Delete Devices on Bridge...""  this will remove a hue devices from the bridge, not from Indigo

* ADDED menu option: "Start Seach for new Devices on Bridge..." this will start the scan process on the bridge to look for new devices. 
   the bridge will scan for 40 secs for new devices. This will not add devices to indigo, use menu "Add New Hue Devices in Indigo..."
   it will do about the same as the iphone hue app.


========================================
2022.11.33 @ 2022-07-16

* ADDED support for Hue Rotary Wall Switch (4 Tap Switches w rotary ring) 
  the most usefull dimmer in the Hue portfolio - In my opinion
  using 
  types   = ZLLRelativeRotary and ZLLswitch
  modelId = RDM002
  it will create 2 indigo devices: 
  hueRotaryWallSwitches (ZLLswitch)  for the 4 buttons
  hueRotaryWallRing (ZLLRelativeRotary)  for the ring to dimm lights 
  on the hue bridge it is also 2 virtual devices 

* ADDED action & menu to dis(en)-able sensor devices (temp, motion, switches) 
  this can be useful when you want to disable certain sensors at night or when you are out or at home
  this is done by setting  element "config":{"on":true/false} on the bridge for the selected device
  you can see which sensors are on/off with report in menu/print hue config../sensors 
  
* ADDED menu option to rename devices on bridge
  you can change individual devices  with free text or all and change the name on the bridge to the indigo device name 
  !! max number of characters is 32 for names on bridge !!
  there is an option to drop the "Hue_bridge_id_"nameOnBridge prefix of indigo names on the bridge for devices generated using plugin/menu/Add new devices
  
* ADDED option "Where to log device value changes"  received from hue bridge
  either (1) in regular indigo log and plugin.log   or   (2) ONLY in plugin.log file in indigo log direcotry
  with this option you can declutter your normal indigo logfile from regular messsages
  reminder: ALL log messages are ALWAYS in the plugin.log file 
 
* ADDED option to print detailed tracking info for ONE specific Sensor or light to logfile 
  this is useful to track the detailed behavior and logic in the plugin for ONE specific device when eg buttons are pressed 
 
*  There are now various options to log device changes in plugin config 
  - on for all devices
  - off for all
  - set in each device individually
  - log in indigo log and plugin.log or only in plugin.log file 
  - set the default for each new device created

* CHANGED state lastupdated is now local time, not UTC  eg 2022-07-12 12:33:45 in stead of 2022-07-12T06:33:45 for USA east cost time zone
   that state is not the last time when an indigo state was updated, but when a new EVENT time stamp arrived

* FIXED bug for  "wall switch" devices status was not properly updated
  REMARK: The defined logic is not 100% correct. There are several modes (set on the bridge), ie when set to on/off
  on bridge the indigo state on/off only stays up for a few seconds. It should stay up as long as the button is pressed.
  This is also the case for all other switch sensors. 
  This will only be corrected going from simple polling every 2 secs to async listening, BUT that is a major structural change for the plugin
   this will take some time

* CHANGED: added debug statement for 'hubNumber' error



========================================
2022.11.31 @ 2022-07-01
fixed
* on/off state and bright ness not properly updating for dimmable lamps 
* fixed on/offstate for all lamps made it consitent
* fixed # of decimal point for RGB, White level, Color Temperature in indigo dev status display


========================================
2022.11.29 @ 2022-06-22 
New functions:
* added state "created". It shows date-time stamp of when device was created, or if it is empty put current stamp in, ie for old devices, as we don't know when they were created.
  this is only useful for new devices created after this release  

* added config option for default logging level(print received value updates to indigo log) for individual devices when they get auto created through "menu/create new devices...", which scannes all bridges and adds missing devices to indigo.

Improvements:
* hue bridge adoption now semi-automatic in background 
  in config after bridgeNumber and ip number confirmed it will try to pair/link to bridge and will show positive result in a popup window
  you still need to press the philips button on top of the bridge
  This way the plugin trys to link to the bridge every 5 seconds. It should succeeed as soon as you go to the bridge and press the button there.
  In case that process fails there is still the execute pair button in the config menu, which starts the paring process after you press the execute pair button

*streamlined device updates: instead of 10+ individual state updates, now it checks if there is a change in state value and then combines updates to a list. 
    That should reduce server load from updates significantly

Fixes:
* fixed some issues in print hue config menu

* lots of little clean-up of typos etc



========================================
2022.11.28 @ 2022-06-19 
*extended expiration time for confirming bridge # to 120 secs (from 15 secs) 
 that should deal with message bridge confirm popup error message 
 Also now after successfull delete / change IP# and (re-)pair bridge 
 the config menu goes back to first step: "Select action for the bridge"

========================================
2022.11.27 @ 2022-06-18 
*fix bugs: 
- line 5383, in excecStatesUpdate;  type: dictionary changed size during iteration
- line 9575, in setColorTemperature:  if bulbId is None or bulbId == 0:

*added debug statement to ID the device for error msg:
-  line 6397, .... 'key brightnessLevel not found in dict'

* added some more config edit controls to make sure data is entered properly
- fields appear only when previous steps taken.



========================================
2022.11.26 @ 2022-06-04
*fix bug:  is not a dimmer device 
*restructured config menu to make it easier to understand 
  for manaing bridges in config flow is now
  - select action (add(pair) / modify(IP) / delete)
  - select select bridge #
  - then set new Ip# ..
  - confirm
  with success / failure popup messages
  ==> should be easy to understand now 

*changed error logging to std python error logging
*added code to check if devices are "orphaned" ie have no bridge or a non existing bridge associated
* *** this version  requires python3 ie only runs uder indigo 2022.1 and later  ***


========================================
2022.11.24 @ 2022-06-02
*bug fix: auto create hue devices did not set rgb white etc properties correctly
*bug fix: save preset error 
*minor menu text changes
*in device light and group edit:
 - only current device is shown
 - if not created yet (=new dev) only NOT used hue devices (ie no indigo dev) are shown
*additions to menu print hue info 
  ie print hue dev but no corresponding indigo dev and visa versa, some more formatted info for other print xxx menu options  
*made MANY more things table driven, not hard coded in plugin, 
 ie supports-xx xx= batterylevel rgb, white, onoff, sensorvalue, is dimmerdevice  etc. 
 all is set in file supportedDevices.py
*added functionality to scan network for hue bridges.
 this done in the backgroud every 5 minutes (using /usr/bin/dns-sd functionality )
 the list of network scan found bridges is available in config when you want to add a new bridge
 in config you can ask to have the scan run immediately.
 if you already know the ipnumber of your bridge this is not needed, but the ip # field is filled out automatically

* *** this version now requires python3 ie only runs uder indigo 2022.1 and later  ***
  it might still work under py2 (earlier than indigo 2022.1) You need to change api version to 2.0 from 3.0 in info.plist, but no support for that



========================================
1.10.24 @ 2022-05-22
*several bug fixes
*config menu was rewritten, should make it much easier to setup / modify bridge settings etc
  reduces error messages if wrong parameters are set etc.
*logging/debug toggle in menu and detailed logging selection in config
*some language clarification in menus 
*  *** still runs under indigo 2022.1 and earlier ***
*  *** if no other MAJOR bugs found, this should be the last version that uns under Python2 ***


========================================

1.2.10 (23-Apr-2014)
* Fixed a bug that would cause the plugin to crash if a command was sent to the hub while the hub (or the plugin) was in an unstable state that resulted in an invalid pairing status.
* Updated the error reporting process so that major connection failure errors were actually reported as errors in the log rather than standard log entries.
* Updated the error reporting process so frequently displayed errors during a network or hub outage are reduced from once every 4 seconds to about once every minute.
--

* Added code to update device error states if a Hue device's online state changes to false, or there's some other kind of error.
* Corrected some UI labeling errors.
--
1.1.0 (18-Aug-2013)

--
1.0.1 (30-Jul-2013)
* Added the indigoPluginUpdateChecker module (code by Travis CooK) to facilitate automatic plugin version checking.
--
1.0 (03-Jul-2013)
* Updated brightness status code to accurately reflect a 1 percent brightness level (rather than rounding up to 2 percent).
* Added Default Brightness property for Hue Bulbs devices so their features are more consistent with other lighting devices in Indigo (such as SwitchLinc and LampLinc Dimmers).
* Changed "on", "off", and "toggle" action control functions so that sending an "on" command to a Hue Bulb from within Indigo returns the bulb to its previous brightness level, or its default brightness level (if set).
* Updated Brightness, HSB, and Color Temperature setting methods so that they properly save the brightness level specified in those actions to the Hue Bulb's device properties for recall should an "on" command be sent to it.
* Updated the bulb status gathering method so that if the bulb brightness changes outside of the Hue Lights plugin (or the hub updates the bulb brightness during a long transition time), Hue Lights does not save the new brightness to the bulb properties and thus causing an "on" command later to recall an incorrect previous brightness state.
* Changed the logging slightly to more closely match the log format of native INSTEON device changes.
--
0.10.2 (24-Jun-2013)
* Added more code to work better with LivingWhites bulbs.
--
0.10.1 (24-Jun-2013)
* Modified debugging code so it wouldn't throw errors when the plugin is installed on versions of Indigo Pro earlier than version 5.1.7.
* Added the LWB003 model ID to the list of recognized Hue models.
--
0.10.0 (12-Jun-2013)
* Added a Hue Bulb Attribute Controller virtual dimmer device which can be created to control a specific attribute (hue, saturation, RGB levels, or color temperature) of an existing Hue Lights bulb device.
* Added an "Effect" action which allows you to specify an effect to be turned on for a Hue bulb (requires latest firmware on the Hue hub. Currently, only the Color Loop effect is supported by the Hue hub and bulbs).
* Changed light control methods so that if the current light brightness is below 6% and the requested action is to turn off the bulb, set the ramp rate to 0 regardless of the default or specified ramp rate (transition time) because going from a brightness of 6% or lower to an off state with a dimming rate isn't noticeable.
--
0.9.11 (10-Apr-2013)
* Updated code to more elegantly handle non-Hue devices attached to the Hue hub.
--
0.9.10 (02-Apr-2013)
* Fixed a bug that would cause the plugin to crash if a registered bulb on the Hue hub had no "hue" attribute (which could happen when using "LivingWhites" plugin dimmers found in some European countries).
--
0.9.9 (24-Jan-2013)
* Attempted to make RGB-to-xyY conversions more accurate by changing the illuminant used by the colormath functions from type "a" to type "e".
--
0.9.8 (23-Jan-2013)
* Fixed a bug that would crash the plugin if no device was selected in a start/stopBrightening/Dimming action when the action was executed.
* Fixed a bug that would cause an error during device creation dialog validation for new Hue Light devices in Indigo 5.x.
--
0.9.7 (31-Dec-2012)
* Fixed a bug that updated the "hue" state of plugin devices with an invalid number when the setHSB action was used.
--
0.9.6 (31-Dec-2012)
* Fixed a divide by zero error in getBulbStatus that could happen if the Hue hub returns no value for a bulb’s color temperature.
--
0.9.5 (27-Dec-2012)
* Fixed bug that would cause the Hue light not to turn off if using RGB mode when Red, Green, and Blue were all zero.
--
0.9.4 (27-Nov-2012)
* Fixed bug that would return an error if no default ramp rate were entered for a Hue bulb device.
* Added more debug logging.
* Changed how logging is done to be more consistent with other Indigo device update events. A log entry now appears after the physical device has changed (as was always the case) but now it appears before the Indigo device state is updated.
* Increased delay between status update requests to about 8 seconds to decrease number of requests per minute sent to the Hue hub.
--
0,9.3 (18-Nov-2012)
* Fixed typo (bug) that caused the plugin to crash when the Hue hub was unreachable within the timeout period.
* Worked around a colormath bug that would throw a ZeroDivisionError if the "y" component was zero.
* Added checks in bulb status gathering to prevent unnecessary Indigo device status updates. Added logging for any device brightness updates detected.
* Added more exception handling for HTTP requests to hub.
* Slightly tweaked status request timing.
--
0.9.2 (17-Nov-2012)
* Corrected error in actionControlDimmerRelay that prevented setBrightness call from working.
--
0.9.1 (16-Nov-2012)
* Tweaked brightening and dimming timing for Start Brightening and Start Dimming actions so the rate was about the same speed as SmartLabs SwithcLinc Dimmers and LampLinc Dimmers.
* Removed code that immediately changes the RGB color states for the Indigo device as the values entered by the user are not actual displayed values. Actual values will be updated by the getBulbStatus method later.
* Added the "Set Brightness with Ramp Rate" action and associated plugin.py code. Renamed multiple methods for easier readability and for easier plugin scripting within Indigo.  Reorganized order in which methods appear in the source code for a more logical layout.
--
0.9 (13-Nov-2012)
* Initial Nathan Sheldon forked beta release.
* This version removes the use of the "ColorPy" library from Alistair's version and replaces it with the "colormath" library as it includes the ability to specify a target illumination source during color conversion, thus presenting a closer RGB to xyY conversion (and vice-versa).
* Most of Alistair's original code was rewritten to remain consistent with coding conventions in my other plugins, but some of his code is still in here.
